## Recruiter Value

This prototype demonstrates:

- clear mental model of embeddings  
- ability to explain abstract ML concepts visually  
- understanding of semantic distance & RAG foundations  
- product instincts for making ML interpretable  
- ability to translate infrastructure into UX  

It’s small, elegant, and extremely high-signal.
